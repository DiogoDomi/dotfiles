# Welcome to my ***Dotfiles*** repository.

In this repository you'll see all my configs from:
- Text-editors
- Shell
- DE
- Other

# Tools

For programming stuff, learning, writing notes and more i'm using these tools:

## Operating System

I am running ***Void Linux*** on my machine. Why? Because it is lightweight, 
doesn't have a hundred software installed by default and i like the package 
manager XBPS and Void-Packages that Void has. I'm using Void with XFCE + I3WM,
my favorite personal config.

> ### **The Void (Linux) distribution**
>---
>**Void** is a general purpose operating system, based on the monolithic 
Linux kernel. Its package system allows you to quickly install, update and 
remove software; software is provided in binary packages or can be built 
directly from sources with the help of the XBPS source packages collection.

## Text-editor / IDE 

Right now i use a combo of Visual Studio Code & NeoVim. I don't like NeoVim so
much for only use it and don't like VSCode so much to don't use neovim. I like
both. Hope someday can use only neovim

> ### **Visual Studio Code**
>---
>**VS Code** is a free code editor, which runs on the macOS, Linux, and Windows
operating systems. Getting up and running with Visual Studio Code is quick and
easy. It is a small download so you can install in a matter of minutes and give
VS Code a try.
>VS Code is lightweight and should run on most available hardware and platform
versions. You can review the System Requirements to check if your computer 
configuration is supported.
